# healthify
Healthify is/will be a complete hospital appointment management, review, and analytics API written in Java/Spring.__
I'm investing in Java/Spring, and this is where I'd like to hone my abilities while progressively increasing the complexity of this hypothetical API.__
I'll post updates following each iteration...__
the fundamental CRUD operations first. Along the way, I'll be adding functionality like Spring Security authentication and authorisation, logging, unit testing, and integration tests.__
Along the way, I also intend to develop more analytics-related or tougher endpoints, such "Get Highest Reviewed Doctors Since a Date," or endpoints that use geolocation, or APIs for recurring appointment scheduling.__
Over time, I hope it can develop into a solid and reliable API.
