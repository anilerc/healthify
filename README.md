# healthify
Written in Java/Spring, healthify will be/is a comprehensive hospital appointment management, review and analytics API.
I am investing in Java/Spring, and here, I would like to practice my skills, while gradually improving the complexity of this imaginary API.
I will be sharing updates after each iteration...
Starting with the basic CRUD operations. Along the way, I will be adding features such as authentication/authorization with Spring Security; logging, unit and integration tests...
Over the time, I also plan to prepare some analytics/trickier endpoints, such as, "Get Highest Reviewed Doctors Since a Date", or, APIs working with geolocation, or, Scheduling Recurring Appointments.
I hope it can evolve as a robust and strong API over the time.
