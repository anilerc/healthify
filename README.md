# healthify
Healthify is/was a complete hospital appointment management, review, and analytics API written in Java/Spring.

I'm investing in Java/Spring, and this is where I'd like to hone my abilities while progressively increasing the complexity of this hypothetical API.

I'll post updates following each iteration...

the fundamental CRUD operations first. Along the way, I'll be adding functionality like Spring Security authentication and authorisation, logging, unit testing, and integration tests.

Along the way, I also intend to develop more analytics-related or tougher endpoints, such "Get Highest Reviewed Doctors Since a Date," or endpoints that use geolocation, or APIs for recurring appointment scheduling.

Over time, I hope it can develop into a solid and reliable API.
