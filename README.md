# healthify
Healthify is/will be a complete hospital appointment management, review, and analytics API written in Java/Spring Boot/Spring Data JPA. N-tier architecture will be used.

I am passionately learning investing in Java/Spring, and this is where I'd like to hone my abilities while progressively increasing the complexity of this hypothetical API.

I'll post updates following each iteration. First, the fundamental CRUD operations will be done. Along the way, I'll be adding functionality like Spring Security authentication and authorization, logging, unit/integration tests and more.

I also intend to develop more analytics-related or trickier endpoints, such as "Get Highest Reviewed Doctors Since a Date," or endpoints that use geolocation, or APIs for recurring appointment scheduling.

Over the time, I hope it can develop into a robust and comprehensive API with proper usage of the best-practices. 

Start date: October 15, 2023.
